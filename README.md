## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- with Visual Studio Code Editor

### What I learned

I learned an uncommon CSS property while building this project

```css
a {
  text-underline-offset: **px;
}
```
what this property does is, give us the accessibility to control the distance between the anchor tag's default underline & the tag's baseline. we can set the distance according to our needs.

### Continued development

I never knew this property exists in CSS until I follow this project & I'm hoping to use this property in my future builds.

### Useful resources

- [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset) more about the 'text-underline-offset' CSS property
